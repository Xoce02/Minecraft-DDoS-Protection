# Minecraft DDoS Protection

This repository contains a BPF program designed to protect Minecraft servers from DDoS attacks. It implements a firewall that analyzes incoming TCP and UDP packets, detecting and blocking potentially harmful traffic based on configurable thresholds.

## ⚠️Development Status

**Please note that this project is currently under development.** The initial version may not function as expected, and we appreciate your understanding as we work to enhance its stability and features. Your feedback is valuable, and contributions are welcome as we improve the functionality.

## Features

- **IP Pattern Tracking**: Records the timestamps of the last few packets received from each IP in a circular buffer (`patterns`), allowing for pattern analysis over time.

- **Dynamic Adjustment of Thresholds**: Allows for potential dynamic adjustments to the thresholds for packet counts, enabling customization based on traffic patterns.

- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Utilizes BPF maps to efficiently store and retrieve statistics, optimizing memory usage for a large number of IPs.

- **Protocol Handling**: Supports both TCP and UDP protocols, ensuring comprehensive monitoring and filtering for a wide range of traffic types.

- **Non-Intrusive Filtering**: Uses XDP for dropping packets at the lowest possible layer, minimizing the impact on server performance and latency.

- **Time-Based Blocking Logic**: Implements a blocking time for IPs that exceed thresholds, which helps prevent temporary spikes in traffic from permanently blocking legitimate users.

- **Logging of Last Packet Time**: Tracks the last packet time for each IP, which aids in detecting rapid-fire attacks or abuse patterns.

- **Low-Level Network Interaction**: Operates at the network interface level, which allows for capturing and processing packets before they reach the kernel networking stack.

- **Customizable Blocking Duration**: The blocking duration can be adjusted through the `BLOCK_TIME` constant, allowing for flexibility in how long an IP should be blocked.

- **Basic Rate Limiting**: Includes basic rate limiting mechanisms by blocking IPs that send packets too frequently, helping to mitigate DDoS attacks.

- **Integration Potential**: The architecture allows for potential integration with other security systems or logging mechanisms for enhanced monitoring.

- **Open Source**: The code is open-source under the [GNU GPLv3](LICENSE), encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community.

- **Modular Design**: Designed in a modular fashion, making it easy to extend functionality or integrate additional features in the future.


## Planned Features and Future Updates

In future updates, we aim to implement the following features:

- **Advanced Traffic Analysis**: Incorporate more sophisticated algorithms to analyze traffic patterns and detect unusual behavior.

- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Allow thresholds for blocking to be dynamically adjusted based on server load and traffic patterns.

- **Whitelist/Blacklist Management**: Implement functionality to manage whitelists and blacklists for IP addresses.

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provide real-time statistics and logs for incoming traffic and blocked requests.

- **Integration with Third-party Tools**: Allow integration with other security tools and dashboards for enhanced monitoring capabilities.

- **User-configurable Options**: Enable users to configure various parameters, such as blocking times, thresholds, and more, through a simple interface.

- **Automated Incident Response**: Develop features that automate responses to detected threats, such as notifying administrators or adjusting security settings in real time.

- **User Role Management**: Introduce role-based access controls to allow different levels of access and functionality for various users.

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implement machine learning algorithms to improve detection capabilities and adapt to new types of attacks over time.

- **Data Export Options**: Provide options to export logs and statistics in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for further analysis or reporting.

- **Custom Alerts and Notifications**: Allow users to set up custom alerts for specific events or thresholds, providing immediate notifications via email or messaging platforms.

- **API for Developers**: Develop an API that allows developers to integrate the DDoS protection features into their own applications or scripts.

- **Improved Documentation**: Continuously enhance the documentation with examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guides to assist users.

- **Load Testing Features**: Add functionality to simulate DDoS attacks in a controlled manner for testing the system's defenses and effectiveness.

- **Enhanced Bot Detection**: Further improve bot detection mechanisms using behavioral analysis and reputation-based systems.

- **Geolocation-based Blocking**: Implement geolocation features to block or allow traffic from specific regions based on user preferences.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a user-friendly GUI to manage and visualize the settings and statistics of the DDoS protection system.

- **Regular Security Audits**: Establish a process for regular security audits and updates to ensure the system remains resilient against new threats.
