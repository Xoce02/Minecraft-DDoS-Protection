# Minecraft DDoS Protection

This repository contains a BPF program designed to protect Minecraft servers from DDoS attacks. It implements a firewall that analyzes incoming TCP and UDP packets, detecting and blocking potentially harmful traffic based on configurable thresholds.

## Development Status

**Please note that this project is currently under development.** The initial version may not function as expected, and we appreciate your understanding as we work to enhance its stability and features. Your feedback is valuable, and contributions are welcome as we improve the functionality.

## Features

- Monitors and counts incoming TCP and UDP packets.
- Blocks IP addresses that exceed defined thresholds for packet counts.
- Implements bot detection mechanisms.
- Uses XDP for high-performance packet processing.

## Planned Features and Future Updates

In future updates, we aim to implement the following features:

- **Advanced Traffic Analysis**: Incorporate more sophisticated algorithms to analyze traffic patterns and detect unusual behavior.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Allow thresholds for blocking to be dynamically adjusted based on server load and traffic patterns.
- **Whitelist/Blacklist Management**: Implement functionality to manage whitelists and blacklists for IP addresses.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provide real-time statistics and logs for incoming traffic and blocked requests.
- **Integration with Third-party Tools**: Allow integration with other security tools and dashboards for enhanced monitoring capabilities.
- **User-configurable Options**: Enable users to configure various parameters, such as blocking times, thresholds, and more, through a simple interface.

## Requirements

- Linux kernel 4.4 or newer
- `clang` and `llvm` for compiling the BPF program
- `libbpf` for loading the BPF program into the kernel

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Minecraft-DDoS-Protection.git
   cd Minecraft-DDoS-Protection
   ```
## Compile the BPF Program

2. To compile the BPF program, use the following command:

```bash
clang -O2 -target bpf -c minecraft.c -o minecraft.o
```
